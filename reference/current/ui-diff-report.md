## Full Visual Differences Report

### Header & Navigation Bar

1. **Hamburger Menu**
   - **Prototype:** A three-line hamburger menu icon is visible on the far left side of the header.
   - **Current Version:** This hamburger menu icon is absent.

2. **Logo**
   - **Prototype:** The logo includes both the icon (blue rounded square with a white paw) and the text "Pampered Pooch." The logo text also has a subtle drop shadow, giving it a slight sense of depth.
   - **Current Version:** The text “Pampered Pooch” is present, but there is no accompanying logo icon and no drop shadow. The text is flat and simpler in style.

3. **Search Bar**
   - **Prototype:** The search bar has a clear separation between the input field and two distinct buttons: a purple **Search** button and a light-gray **Clear** button with rounded corners. The input field is shorter in width compared to the current version.
   - **Current Version:** The search bar is longer, without a dedicated **Search** button. Instead, it only contains a plain **Clear** text link inside the input field on the right side. The placeholder text is more left-aligned in this version.

4. **Clear Button Placement & Style**
   - **Prototype:** The **Clear** button appears outside the input field, styled with a light gray background and rounded corners.
   - **Current Version:** The **Clear** text is unstyled, simply placed inside the input field.

5. **Date and Time Display**
   - **Prototype:** The date and time are displayed in a pill-shaped container with a purple background. The font weight is bolder, and the style is more visually prominent.
   - **Current Version:** The date and time are displayed as plain dark text, smaller in scale and without a background container.

### Main Content Area

6. **Overall Layout & Background**
   - **Prototype:** The main content area appears as a distinct card, centered on the page, surrounded by a thick gradient border (blue-to-purple) with a large corner radius. This card design provides strong visual separation from the background. The page background itself is vibrant and saturated, with a blue-to-purple gradient.
   - **Current Version:** The main content area blends more with the background. The background is a muted lavender tone, and there is only a subtle purple glow effect at the very top. The central container does not stand out as strongly as a separate card.

7. **Search Icon**
   - **Prototype:** The magnifying glass icon is centered and slightly larger. Its placement is aligned with the extra padding above the card content.
   - **Current Version:** The magnifying glass icon is smaller and sits slightly higher, with tighter spacing above.

8. **Heading: “Search for Animals”**
   - **Prototype:** The heading is larger, bold, and stands out strongly.
   - **Current Version:** The heading uses a thinner font weight and is slightly smaller.

9. **Instructional Text**
   - **Prototype:** The text "Enter an animal name, breed, or owner in the search box above to find grooming records." is larger and has more line spacing, making it more readable.
   - **Current Version:** The text is smaller, more condensed, and visually lighter.

10. **Search Suggestions (Pills)**

- **Prototype:** The suggestion pills are styled as ghost buttons with a thin gray outline and dark text. They appear as four separate buttons: `Cody`, `Maltese`, `James`, and `Active pets`. The horizontal spacing between them is wider, and they are not grouped together.
- **Current Version:** The suggestion pills are grouped inside a light-gray container. They are filled with a light-gray background and styled with softer rounded corners. The four suggestions are `Cody`, `Maltese`, `James`, and `active` (note the lowercase difference compared to "Active pets").

### Miscellaneous Elements

11. **Bottom-Left Icon**

- **Prototype:** There is no additional icon in the bottom-left corner.
- **Current Version:** A dark, circular icon with the letter "N" is visible in the bottom-left corner.

12. **Left-Side Vertical Bar**

- **Prototype:** No vertical element is visible on the left edge.
- **Current Version:** A thin vertical bar is visible on the far-left edge of the screen, possibly indicating a collapsed sidebar or scrollbar.

## Final Comprehensive Summary

- **Header and Navigation:** Prototype includes a hamburger menu, a shadowed logo, a shorter search bar with distinct Search and Clear buttons, and a bold date/time in a purple pill container. Current version removes the hamburger menu, uses only flat text for the logo, features a longer search bar with an inline Clear text, and places the date/time as plain dark text.

- **Main Content:** Prototype has a card-style layout with bold gradient borders and vibrant background. Current version uses a muted lavender background with less emphasis on card separation. Headings and instructional text are bolder and more prominent in the prototype.

- **Search Suggestions:** Prototype uses ghost-style pills with wider spacing and the term "Active pets." Current version uses filled pill buttons inside a grouped light-gray container, with the last suggestion displayed as "active."

- **Extra UI Elements:** Current version adds a bottom-left circular "N" icon and a thin left-side vertical bar, both absent from the prototype.
