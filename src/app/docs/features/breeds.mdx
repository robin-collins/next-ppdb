# Breeds Management

The breed database stores all available breeds with their associated grooming times and pricing.

## Page Header

Navigate to **Manage Breeds** from the sidebar to access this page.

## Adding a New Breed

Use the "Add New Breed" form at the top of the page:

![Add New Breed Form](/docs/screenshots/breeds-add-form.png)

| Field        | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Breed Name   | Required - Enter the breed name (e.g., "Golden Retriever")  |
| Average Time | Grooming duration in HH:MM:SS format (default: 01:00:00)    |
| Average Cost | Base price in dollars (default: lowest existing breed cost) |

### Time Format Examples

- `01:00:00` = 1 hour
- `01:30:00` = 1 hour 30 minutes
- `00:45:00` = 45 minutes

## Existing Breeds Database

The table displays all breeds with sortable columns:

![Breeds Table](/docs/screenshots/breeds-table.png)

| Column       | Description                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Breed Name   | Name of the breed                 |
| Average Time | Estimated grooming duration       |
| Average Cost | Base grooming price               |
| Actions      | Edit, Delete, and Pricing buttons |

### Searching Breeds

Use the search box above the table to filter breeds by name. Filtering is applied in real-time as you type.

### Modify All Pricing

Click the **Modify All Pricing** button to apply bulk pricing changes to all breeds simultaneously.

![Bulk Pricing Modal](/docs/screenshots/breeds-bulk-pricing-modal.png)

#### Adjustment Types

| Type         | Description                                | Example            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Fixed Amount | Add a specific dollar amount to all prices | +$10 to all breeds |
| Percentage   | Increase prices by a percentage            | +5% to all breeds  |

#### How Bulk Pricing Works

When you apply a bulk pricing change:

1. All breed `avgcost` values are updated by the specified amount
2. Animal costs at or below their breed's avgcost are increased proportionally
3. Animals with custom pricing (above breed avgcost) preserve their price difference
4. Animals with $0 cost remain unchanged (discounted pricing preserved)

#### Using the Pricing Modal

1. Select **Fixed Amount ($)** or **Percentage (%)**
2. Enter the adjustment value (must be greater than 0)
3. Review the warning about what the operation will do
4. Click **Apply to All Breeds** to confirm

## Editing a Breed

Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) next to any breed:

1. Modify the breed name, time, or cost
2. Click **Save** to apply changes
3. Click **Cancel** to discard changes

## Deleting a Breed

Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) next to any breed.

### Safe Deletion (Mandatory Migration)

If animals are currently assigned to the breed, you **cannot delete it directly**. The system requires you to migrate those animals to another breed first:

1. Click the **Delete** button
2. A dialog shows how many animals use this breed
3. Select a **target breed** from the dropdown to migrate animals to
4. Click **Migrate and Delete** to proceed

This prevents orphaned animal records and ensures data integrity.

### Deleting Unused Breeds

If no animals are assigned to the breed:

1. Click the **Delete** button
2. A confirmation dialog appears
3. Click **Confirm** to delete the breed

### Duplicate Prevention

When adding or editing breeds, the system validates for duplicate names (case-insensitive). You cannot create a breed named "Poodle" if "POODLE" or "poodle" already exists.

## Individual Pricing

Click the **$** button next to any breed to:

- Apply a percentage increase/decrease
- Set a fixed price override
- Reset to the base price

## Breed Avatars

Each breed has an associated avatar image displayed in:

- Search result cards
- Animal detail pages
- Customer history tables

Avatars are stored in `/public/images/animal-avatars/`.
