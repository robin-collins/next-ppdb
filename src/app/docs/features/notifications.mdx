# Notifications

Next PPDB includes a notification system that keeps you informed about important events, system updates, and alerts.

## Notification Bell

The notification bell icon appears in the header across all pages.

| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| No notifications | Bell icon shows "No notifications"      |

Click the bell icon to navigate to the Notifications page.

## Notifications Page

Navigate to **Notifications** from the sidebar or by clicking the bell icon in the header.

### Current Notifications

Active notifications appear in the "Current Notifications" section. Each notification displays:

| Element   | Description                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Icon      | Color-coded by priority (Error/Warning/Success) |
| Title     | Brief description of the notification           |
| Timestamp | When the notification was generated             |
| Actions   | Mark as read, archive, or delete                |

### Priority Colors

Notifications are color-coded by severity:

| Priority | Color  | Examples                              |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Error    | Red    | Failed backups, system errors         |
| Warning  | Yellow | Pending updates, storage warnings     |
| Success  | Green  | Completed backups, successful imports |
| Info     | Blue   | General system information            |

### Archived Notifications

Click "Archived Notifications" to expand and view previously archived notifications. Archived items are kept for reference but don't appear in the active notification count.

## Notification Types

The system generates notifications for various events:

### Backup Events

- Successful backup creation
- Backup failures
- Low backup storage warnings

### System Updates

- New version available
- Update completed successfully
- Update failures or rollback required

### Import Events

- Data import completed
- Import validation warnings
- Failed import attempts

### Administrative Alerts

- Database connection issues
- Configuration changes
- Scheduled maintenance reminders

## Managing Notifications

### Mark as Read

Click the checkmark icon to mark a notification as read. Read notifications remain visible but with reduced emphasis.

### Archive

Click the archive icon to move a notification to the archived section. Use this for notifications you've addressed but want to keep for reference.

### Delete

Click the delete icon to permanently remove a notification. This action cannot be undone.

### Refresh

Click the **Refresh** button to check for new notifications without reloading the page.

## Best Practices

### Regular Review

- Check notifications daily for important alerts
- Address error notifications promptly
- Archive resolved items to keep the current list manageable

### Priority Response

| Priority | Recommended Response Time |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Error    | Immediate                 |
| Warning  | Within 24 hours           |
| Success  | Review at convenience     |
| Info     | Review at convenience     |

### Notification Hygiene

- Archive or delete notifications after addressing them
- Review archived notifications periodically
- Don't ignore recurring warnings

## Email Notifications

For critical events, the system can send email notifications to configured administrators. This ensures important alerts aren't missed even when the application isn't actively being used.

Email notifications are sent for:

- Backup failures
- System errors
- Critical security alerts

See [Administration](/docs/features/admin) for email configuration details.
