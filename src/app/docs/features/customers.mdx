### Customer Statistics

The detail page displays activity insights:

| Statistic    | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Years Active | How long this customer has been using your service |
| Total Visits | Cumulative grooming appointments across all pets   |
| Animal Count | Number of pets registered to this customer         |

### Quick Actions

- **Add Animal** - Register a new pet
- **Edit Customer** - Update information
- **Delete Customer** - Remove customer and manage their animals
- **View History** - See complete visit history

## Deleting a Customer

Click the **Delete** button on the customer detail page to remove a customer record.

### Selective Rehoming

If the customer has animals, you have options for handling them:

1. **Delete All Animals** - Remove the customer and all their pet records
2. **Rehome Animals** - Transfer pets to a different owner before deleting

#### Rehoming Process

When selecting rehome:

1. A modal displays all animals belonging to the customer
2. Select which animals to rehome (checkboxes)
3. Search for and select the new owner
4. Click **Rehome Selected** to transfer ownership
5. After rehoming, proceed with customer deletion

This feature is useful when:

- A pet changes ownership (sold, gifted, etc.)
- Family members split and take different pets
- Correcting data entry mistakes

### Customers Without Animals

If the customer has no animals, deletion proceeds with a simple confirmation dialog.

### Validation & Safety

- You cannot delete a customer while actively editing their record
- The system confirms the action before permanent deletion
- Deleted customer data cannot be recovered (ensure backups exist)

## Customer History

The Customer History report identifies inactive customers:

## Best Practices

- **Use consistent naming** - Capitalize surnames consistently
- **Add multiple phone numbers** - Customers often have mobile, home, and work numbers
- **Include email addresses** - Useful for sending reminders
