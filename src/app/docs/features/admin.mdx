# Administration

Next PPDB includes administrative tools for database management and system maintenance.

## Database Backup

The backup feature creates complete copies of your database.

Navigate to **Database Backup** from the sidebar.

### Create New Backup

Click the button to create an instant backup:

![Create Backup](/docs/screenshots/admin-create-backup.png)

Each backup contains:

- Complete SQL dump of all tables
- Table structure definitions
- All data records
- Compressed as a ZIP file

### Available Backups

The system stores up to 5 recent backups:

![Available Backups](/docs/screenshots/admin-backups-list.png)

| Column    | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filename  | Timestamped filename (e.g., `20251202-000317-backup.zip`) |
| Date/Time | When the backup was created                               |
| Size      | File size in KB                                           |
| Download  | Link to download the backup                               |

### Downloading Backups

Click **Download** to save a backup. Store backups:

- On external drives
- In cloud storage
- Off-site for disaster recovery

### Automatic Cleanup

When more than 5 backups exist, the oldest are automatically removed. Download important backups before cleanup.

## Restoring from Backup

To restore a backup:

1. Download the backup ZIP file
2. Extract the SQL file
3. Import using your database tool:

```bash
mysql -u user -p database_name < backup.sql
```

**Warning**: Restoring overwrites all current data. Create a fresh backup first.

## Email Notifications

The system can send email notifications for backup events to configured administrators.

### Notification Types

| Event           | Description                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Backup Success  | Confirmation when a backup completes      |
| Backup Failure  | Alert when a backup fails                 |
| Storage Warning | Notice when backup storage is running low |

### Configuration

Email notifications require SMTP configuration in your environment. Contact your system administrator to enable this feature.

## Import Log Archives

After importing data (during initial setup or restoration), the system creates detailed import logs.

### Accessing Import Logs

1. Navigate to the **Database Backup** page
2. Look for the "Import Logs" section
3. Click **Download** to retrieve compressed log archives

### Log Contents

Import logs include:

- Records processed and imported
- Validation warnings and errors
- Orphaned record handling
- Date repair operations
- Import duration and summary

These logs are useful for troubleshooting import issues and auditing data migrations.

## System Updates

Navigate to **System Updates** from the sidebar to manage application updates.

### Update Features

- View current version and available updates
- Apply updates with one click
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Update history and changelog

### Update Process

1. The system checks for available updates
2. Review the changelog for new features and fixes
3. Click **Apply Update** to begin
4. The system backs up current state before updating
5. If the update fails, automatic rollback restores the previous version

## Best Practices

### Regular Backups

- Create backups daily or before major changes
- Download backups to external storage
- Test restore procedures periodically

### Before Major Changes

Create a backup before:

- Bulk updates to records
- Database migrations
- System upgrades

### Disaster Recovery

Maintain:

- Multiple backup copies in different locations
- Documentation of restore procedures
- Contact information for technical support
