| Element       | Description                         |

### Two-Column Layout

The card design splits information into two columns:

- **Left Column**: Animal details (name, breed, sex, last visit)
- **Right Column**: Customer details (name, contact info)

This high-density layout shows more information at a glance while maintaining readability.

### Actionable Contact Details

Contact information is interactive:

- **Phone numbers** - Click to initiate a call directly from your device
- **Email addresses** - Click to compose a new email in your default mail client

These features save time by eliminating the need to copy/paste contact details.

### List View

Toggle to list view for a compact table format.

![Phone Search With Spaces](/docs/screenshots/phone-search-2.png)

The system normalizes phone numbers, stripping spaces and formatting before matching.

## Pagination

![Pagination](/docs/screenshots/pagination.png)

### Controls

- **Previous/Next** - Navigate one page at a time
- **Page Numbers** - Jump to specific pages
- **Results Per Page** - Choose 10, 20, 50, or 100 results

## Search Algorithm

Results are ranked by relevance:

| Match Type         | Score      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Exact match        | 100 points |
| Starts with        | 80 points  |
| Contains           | 50 points  |
| Fuzzy match (70%+) | 30 points  |

Multi-word searches score each term independently with diversity bonuses applied.

## Tips

- **Partial names work** - Search "Shep" to find "German Shepherd"
- **Phone digits only** - Just enter the numbers, ignore formatting
- **Multiple terms** - Space-separated words search across all fields
- **Case insensitive** - "BUDDY" finds "Buddy" and "buddy"
