The user wants me to access 'http://localhost:3000' using the chrome-devtools MCP server. This is the development server for their Next.js application.

I should:
1. First check if there are any pages already open
2. Navigate to localhost:3000 or open a new page
3. Take a snapshot to see what's on the page

Let me start by listing the pages to see if Chrome is already running with any pages.</details></think>

I'll access the local development server using the Chrome DevTools MCP server. Let me start by checking what pages are currently open.

I got an error that the target is closed. This likely means Chrome isn't running or the MCP server needs to connect to a new browser instance. Let me try to create a new page directly, which should start Chrome if needed.</details></think>

I'm getting a protocol error indicating the target is closed. This suggests the Chrome DevTools MCP server might not be properly connected or Chrome needs to be started. The error "Target closed" typically means the browser instance isn't available.

Let me inform the user about this issue. They may need to:
1. Make sure the dev server is running (pnpm dev)
2. Check if the Chrome DevTools MCP server is properly configured and running
3. Potentially restart the MCP server connection</details></think>

I'm encountering a protocol error when trying to access the Chrome DevTools MCP server. The error "Target closed" indicates that Chrome isn't currently available or the MCP server connection needs to be established.

To access your application at `http://localhost:3000`, you'll need to:

1. **Ensure the dev server is running**: 
   - Run `pnpm dev` in your terminal if it's not already running

2. **Check the Chrome DevTools MCP server**:
   - The MCP server needs to have an active Chrome instance
   - You may need to restart or reconfigure the Chrome DevTools MCP connection in your Cursor settings

Would you like me to:
- Start the development server for you (`pnpm dev`)?
- Help troubleshoot the MCP server connection?
- Or if you can manually launch Chrome and navigate to localhost:3000, I can try alternative approaches to inspect the application?

Chrome DevTools still returns `Target closed`, which means no Chrome instance is available from the MCP server. To proceed, launch Chrome through the MCP integration (e.g., restart the Chrome DevTools MCP server or open Chrome via Cursor) and then let me know so I can connect again.

The Chrome DevTools MCP server still reports `Target closed`, so it can’t open or list pages. You’ll need to launch or reconnect the Chrome DevTools MCP session (for example, by restarting the integration in Cursor) and confirm once it’s up—then I can try again.
