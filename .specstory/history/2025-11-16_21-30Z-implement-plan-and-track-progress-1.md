# Implement plan and track progress (2025-11-16 21:30Z)

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.
