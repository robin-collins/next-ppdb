# Gather screenshots using playwright (2025-09-16 06:17Z)

_**User (2025-09-16 04:31Z)**_

use playwright to gather screenshots of all the states / elements of the file @ppdb_search_results.html . It looks good, has the top navbar, right hand sidebar, center and search content. Also resizable and pinnable sidebar. Gather screenshots of all these elements, as well as hover states for search listing items and cards. screenshots that are specific to each element and state will make it straightforward to convert to nextjs

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to use Playwright to gather screenshots of all the states/elements of the HTML file `reference/redesign/ppdb_search_results.html`. They want to capture various elements and states including:

1. The top navbar
2. Sidebar (right-hand sidebar mentioned, but looking at the HTML it seems to be left sidebar)
3. Center content and search content
4. Resizable and pinnable sidebar states
5. Hover states for search listing items and cards
6. Different element-specific screenshots to help with NextJS conversion

Let me break this down into a systematic approach:

1. First, I need to open the HTML file in the browser
2. Take screenshots of different states:
   - Default state (empty search)
   - Sidebar closed
   - Sidebar open
   - Sidebar pinned
   - Search results in grid view
   - Search results in list view
   - Hover states for cards
   - Hover states for list items
   - Individual elements like navbar, sidebar components

Let me start by navigating to the HTML file and taking systematic screenshots.</details></think>

I'll use Playwright to capture comprehensive screenshots of all the states and elements in the HTML file. Let me start by navigating to the file and systematically capturing different states and interactions.

```bash
cd /home/tech/projects/ppdb-ts
```

```
❯ cd /home/tech/projects/ppdb-ts

ppdb-ts on  master [!?] via  v20.18.3 on ☁️  (us-east-2) on ☁️

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to use Playwright to capture comprehensive screenshots of all the states and elements in the HTML file `reference/redesign/ppdb_search_results.html`. Looking at the attached files, I can see there's already a Playwright setup in the project with an e2e test file.

Let me start by navigating to the HTML file with Playwright and capturing screenshots of:

1. Initial empty state
2. Header with search bar
3. Sidebar (closed state)
4. Sidebar (open state)
5. Sidebar (pinned state)
6. Search results in grid view
7. Search results in list view
8. Hover states on cards
9. Hover states on list items
10. Resizable sidebar
11. Mobile responsive states

I should create a systematic approach to capture all these states.</details></think>
