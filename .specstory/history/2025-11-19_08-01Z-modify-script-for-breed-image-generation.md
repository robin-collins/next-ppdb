# Modify script for breed image generation (2025-11-19 08:01Z)

_**User (2025-11-30 07:21Z)**_

@scripts/ai_studio_code.py:1-123 This code should iterate over the breed list and use that to modify the BASE_PROMPT to then generate an image. It needs to save the generated image in a subfolder with the name 'generated-images-[DATETIME]' where DATETIME is in format 'YYYYMMDD-HHmmss', and name the saved file with the breed name as part of the file aka 'airdale-avatar.png'. I want it to stop and ask about generating each image, eg: generate image `breedname`: Y/N/A with yes, no or AUTO where AUTO stops asking thereafter, and just completes all list items
