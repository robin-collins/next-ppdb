Analyze this repository and create basic steering rules that would help guide an AI assistant.

Steering documents are markdown files that are always in '.projects/steering'.

Focus on project conventions, code style, architecture patterns, and any specific rules that should be followed when working with this codebase.

For the initial setup, please only create the following files:

- product.md: Short summary of the product
- tech.md: Build system used, tech stack, libraries, frameworks etc. If there are any common commands for building, testing, compiling etc make sure to include a section for that
- structure.md: Project organization and folder structure

You do not need to create any folders. They have been created for you.

The goal is to be succinct, but capture information that will be useful for an LLM application operating in this project.
